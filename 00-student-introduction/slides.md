# FIRST Robotics Introduction for Students

<br/><br/><br/><br/>

## St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute

---

## What is FIRST?

[_FIRST_â€™s](https://firstinspires.org/) goal is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders and innovators.

- Acronym: _**F**or **I**nspiration & **R**ecognition of **S**cience & **T**echnology_
- Focus on **Coopertition** and **Gracious Professionalism**
- Founded by Dean Kamen and Woodie Flowers in 1989
- 3,900+ teams with ~97,000 students from around the world
- **$80 million in scholarships** (!!!) across 3,000+ opportunities

---

## What is FIRST?

> **FIRST is more than robots.** The robots are a vehicle for students to learn important life skills. Kids often come in not knowing what to expect â€“ of the program nor of themselves. They leave, even after the first season, with a **vision**, with **confidence**, and with a sense that **they can create their own future.**

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Co-Founder Dean Kamen

---

### Gracious Professionalism

- **Knowledge**, **competition**, and **empathy**
  - Encourage high-quality work from students
  - Emphasize the value of others
  - Teach respect for individuals and the community


> Gracious professionals learn and compete like crazy, but treat one another with respect and kindness in the process.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Co-Founder Woodie Flowers

---

### Coopertition

Cooperation + Competition = Coopertition

- Cooperation produces innovation
  - Displaying **unqualified kindness** and **respect** in the face of fierce competition
  - Teams can and should **help** and **cooperate** with each other even as they compete

**Team Mentality** will always produce better results!

# So What About the Robots?

---

## A Yearly Competition

- Every year, a new game is announced that every team will try to tackle and come up with a solution to solve
  - [2019â€™s game was _FIRST Deep Space_](https://youtu.be/sHwtGhDEZfM?t=28), where teams competed to outpace their opponents to place Hatch Panels & Cargo balls into the appropriate areas

---

## A Yearly Competition

Teams are tasked with building a robot that overcomes the game's challenges through inovative solutions

Most years have two modes; **autonomous** & **teleoperated**

- Robots are autonomous and drive on their own for the first 15 seconds of the match to score bonus points
- A human driver controls the robot for the remaining match time using teleoperated controls, like an Xbox controller

#### These robots are no slouches or little toys though

## FRC Robotics Overview

**We compete in FRC**, the highest level of FIRST competition

- 120lb robot maximum weight
- Multiple subsystems
  - Lifts, elevators, climbers, ball shooters, & more
  - Powerful motors
  - Speeds of up to 10mt/s (22 mph)
  - Pneumatics (air pistons and valves)

---

# What Does It Take to Build a Robot?

---

Robots are complicated machines that require teamwork to design, build, and perform

- Multi-disciplinary collaboration
  - Mechanical design & prototyping
  - Electrical systems
  - Manufacturing & fabrication
  - Software programming
  - And much more!

The team has 6-10 weeks to go from an idea to a fully operational robot to compete in the local competitions

---

## More Than Just Engineering

A robotics team takes more than just engineering. It requires individuals interested in many different non-STEM fields as well

- Public relations
  - Artwork
  - Brand design
  - Sponsorship & donation outreach
- Finance & budget management
- Competition scouting

# What's the Timeline Look Like?

---

## What's the Timeline Look Like?

There are four major "time blocks" for a FIRST robotics team

- The **Build Season** runs from January to the end of February
- **Competition Season** runs from March and April
- The **Preseason** runs from September (now!) through December, up until the Build Season starts
- The offseason runs from the end of Competition Season into the fall when the Preseason begins

---

### The Preseason

The preseason is used to prepare the team for the upcoming season

- Timeline: September thru December
- Duties:
  - Recruit new members
  - (Re)train on safety, machinery, and processes
  - Refresh business & art material
  - Fundraise as needed

---

### The Build Season

The build season is when the game is revealed, and the team designs & builds a robot to overcome the given challenges

- Timeline: January & February (potentially early March)
- Duties:
  - Understand the game rules
  - Envision robot subsystems
  - Design [CAD models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design), build, & assemble components
  - Drive training on a practice field

---

### The Competition Season

The competition season is when we travel to a regional event to compete against other teams in 3 vs 3 alliances over a weekend

- Timeline: March & April
- Duties:
  - Drive the robot
  - Scout other teams for match strategy
  - Inspect & repair the robot as needed
  - Submit & present for team & individual awards

--- 

### The Competition Season (cont)

Our team's usual regional is hosted at the Rochester Institute of Technology (R.I.T.). We bring a mini-bus & a subset of the team (~15 people) to partake in the weekend-long event.

Teams that win regionals - or special awards - are invited to the **World Championships**, where they compete against the best-of-the best FRC teams in the world.

Pending budget, team size, and robot completion, the team _may_ attend a second regional event, but that is unknown at this time.

## What is Expected of You?

We will give you the tools to grow & develop across multiple disciplines

- Show up as much as you can
- Contribute your ideas, interests, and skills
- Ask questions when you don't know something
- **Be Safe** (Less injuries is good ðŸ¤•)
- Communicate with mentors in a timely fashion

We will give you as much responsibility as you want
